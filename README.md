# Altered Beast (Arcade) Disassembly and Graphics Tools

Welcome to the Altered Beast (Sega System 16) arcade game disassembly project!  
This repository contains disassembled source code and a suite of Python scripts that analyze and regenerate original game backgrounds and in-game sprites for educational and preservation purposes.

## Introduction

Altered Beast is a classic 1988 arcade game developed by Sega for the System 16B hardware. This project aims to document, analyze, and help others understand how the game’s code and graphics work at a low level.  
All disassembly, code comments, and tooling are provided for **educational and research purposes only**.

## Features

- **A mostly commented 68000 disassembly** of the original game code
- **Python tools** for decoding, analyzing, and regenerating game graphics (backgrounds, sprites, etc.)
- The idea was to understand how and what it took to produce the game, how it stored the maps, and graphics in-game
> **Note:**  
> The Python scripts require access to the original arcade ROM files to function.  
> **No ROMs or copyrighted Sega assets are provided or distributed with this repository.**  
> You must supply your own legally obtained ROMs for data extraction or visualization.
